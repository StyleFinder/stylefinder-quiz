Scoring - For Section 1, calculate the number of 'true's for each letter group (A_H).

Section 2, add up the number of times an 'answer letter' is choosen (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h).

Total scores for each letter by combining the number of 'true' in each Letter Group in Section 1 with the corresponding Letter in Section 2.

For example, in Section 1, Group A the user marked four questions as true. This equals four points. In Section 2, the answer A was chossen 12 out of 17 times, for a Section 2 score of 12. The Final total is the sum of Section 1 and Section 2 for each letter (A-H). In this example the final score for A = 16.

Each Letter (A_H) represents a 'StyleID'. Dramatic (A), Whimsical(B), Classic(C), Romantic(D), Sporty(E), Delicate(F), Contemporary(G), Natural(H);

The StyleID are seperated into 2 categories, Yang and Yin. Yang words: Classic(C) , Dramatic (A), Contemporary(G), Sporty(E). Yin words: Natural(H), Whimsical(B), Romantic(D), Delicate(F)

Quiz results - The StyleID (or letter) with the highest number = 'Primary' Word. If the 'Primary' word is a Yang word, the 'Secondary' Word is the highest score from the Yin category. If the highest scrore is a Yin word then the 'Secondary' word is the highest score from the Yang category. Each result must have one StyleID from each category. The 'Supporting' word is the StyleID with the 3rd highest score, regardless of category.

In the event of a Yin and Yang word having the same high score, Yang = Primary and Yin = Secondary.

The StyleID with the highest score is primary. If tied, choose the yang (Classic(C) , Dramatic (A), Contemporary(G), Sporty(E)) as primary word and yin (Natural(H), Whimsical(B), Romantic(D), Delicate(F)) as secondary. Otherwise, Choose the primary word, the secondary word (opposite of yin/yang of primary), and supporting word.
