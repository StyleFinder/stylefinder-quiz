### Environment Setup

1. **Copy environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure email settings in `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com  
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   COACH_EMAIL=coach@yourdomain.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Scoring Algorithm Verified ✅

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Section 1: True/False scoring (7 points max per style)
- ✅ Section 2: Multiple choice frequency counting (17 points max per style)
- ✅ Total scoring range: 0-24 points per style
- ✅ Primary/Secondary/Supporting determination
- ✅ Yin/Yang category logic (Yang wins ties)
- ✅ Edge case handling and validation

**Example Output:**
```
Primary: Contemporary (G) - Score: 10/24
Secondary: Whimsical (B) - Score: 3/24 (opposite category)
Supporting: Dramatic (A) - Score: 9/24
```

### Next Steps (Week 2)

1. **Quiz Interface Components**
   - User info form (name, email)
   - Section 1: 8 groups × 7 True/False questions
   - Section 2: 17 multiple choice questions
   - Progress indicators and navigation

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/submit-quiz` - Process submissions and send email
   - Form validation and error handling

3. **Results Pages**
   - Dynamic routes for each style type
   - Style descriptions and characteristics

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Ready for Week 2 Implementation

The foundation is solid and tested. All core logic is implemented and verified. Week 2 can focus purely on UI components and user experience without worrying about the underlying scoring system.
